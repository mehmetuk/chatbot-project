  # 1) Purpose of ISO 50001
  utter_purpose_iso:
    - text: |
        The purpose of this International Standard is to enable organizations to establish the systems
        and processes necessary to improve energy performance, including energy efficiency, use and
        consumption. Implementation of this International Standard is intended to lead to reductions
        in greenhouse gas emissions and other related environmental impacts and energy cost through
        systematic management of energy. This International Standard is applicable to all types and sizes
        of organizations, irrespective of geographical, cultural or social conditions. Successful implementation
        depends on commitment from all levels and functions of the organization, and especially from top management.

  # 2) What is EnMS?
  utter_what_is_enms:
    - text: |
        energy management system
        EnMS
        set of interrelated or interacting elements to establish an energy policy and energy objectives, and processes
        and procedures to achieve those objectives

  # 3) Energy performance
  utter_what_is_energy_performance:
    - text: |
        energy performance
        measurable results related to energy efficiency (3.8), energy use (3.18) and energy consumption (3.7)
        NOTE 1 In the context of energy management systems, results can be measured against the organization's energy
        policy, objectives, targets and other energy performance requirements.
        NOTE 2 Energy performance is one component of the performance of the energy management system.

  # 4) Energy review
  utter_what_is_energy_review:
    - text: |
        energy review
        determination of the organization's energy performance based on data and other information, leading to
        identification of opportunities for improvement

  # 5) Energy baseline
  utter_what_is_energy_baseline:
    - text: |
        energy baseline
        quantitative reference(s) providing a basis for comparison of energy performance
        NOTE 1 An energy baseline reflects a specified period of time.
        NOTE 2 An energy baseline can be normalized using variables which affect energy use and/or consumption,
        e.g. production level, degree days (outdoor temperature), etc.
        NOTE 3 The energy baseline is also used for calculation of energy savings, as a reference before and after
        implementation of energy performance improvement actions.

  # 6) EnPI
  utter_what_is_enpi:
    - text: |
        energy performance indicator
        EnPI
        quantitative value or measure of energy performance, as defined by the organization
        NOTE EnPIs could be expressed as a simple metric, ratio or a more complex model.

  # 7) Energy policy requirement
  utter_energy_policy_requirement:
    - text: |
        The energy policy shall state the organization's commitment to achieving energy performance improvement.
        Top management shall define the energy policy and ensure that it:
        a) is appropriate to the nature and scale of the organization's energy use and consumption;
        b) includes a commitment to continual improvement in energy performance;
        c) includes a commitment to ensure the availability of information and of necessary resources to achieve
        objectives and targets;
        d) includes a commitment to comply with applicable legal requirements and other requirements to which the
        organization subscribes related to its energy use, consumption and efficiency;
        e) provides the framework for setting and reviewing energy objectives and targets;
        f) supports the purchase of energy-efficient products and services, and design for energy performance
        improvement;
        g) is documented and communicated at all levels within the organization;
        h) is regularly reviewed, and updated as necessary.

  # 8) Scope (term)
  utter_scope_iso:
    - text: |
        scope
        extent of activities, facilities and decisions that the organization addresses through an EnMS, which can
        include several boundaries
        NOTE The scope can include energy related to transport.
